# SNIP-20 Reference Implementation

This is an implementation of a [SNIP-20](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-20.md), [SNIP-21](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-21.md), [SNIP-22](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-22.md), [SNIP-23](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-23.md), [SNIP-24](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-24.md), [~~SNIP-25~~](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-25.md), [SNIP-26](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-26.md), [~~SNIP-50~~](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-50.md) and [SNIP-52](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-52.md) compliant token contract.

> **Note:**
> The master branch contains new features not covered by officially-released SNIPs and may be subject to change. When releasing a token on mainnet, we recommend you start with a [tagged release](https://github.com/scrtlabs/snip20-reference-impl/tags) to ensure compatibility with SNIP standards.

At the time of token creation you may configure:
* Public Total Supply:  If you enable this, the token's total supply will be displayed whenever a TokenInfo query is performed.  DEFAULT: false
* Enable Deposit: If you enable this, you will be able to convert from SCRT to the token.*  DEFAULT: false
* Enable Redeem: If you enable this, you will be able to redeem your token for SCRT.*  It should be noted that if you have redeem enabled, but deposit disabled, all redeem attempts will fail unless someone has sent SCRT to the token contract.  DEFAULT: false
* Enable Mint: If you enable this, any address in the list of minters will be able to mint new tokens.  The admin address is the default minter, but can use the set/add/remove_minters functions to change the list of approved minting addresses.  DEFAULT: false
* Enable Burn: If you enable this, addresses will be able to burn tokens.  DEFAULT: false


\*:The conversion rate will be 1 uscrt for 1 minimum denomination of the token.  This means that if your token has 6 decimal places, it will convert 1:1 with SCRT.  If your token has 10 decimal places, it will have an exchange rate of 10000 SCRT for 1 token.  If your token has 3 decimal places, it will have an exchange rate of 1000 tokens for 1 SCRT.  You can use the exchange_rate query to view the exchange rate for the token.  The query response will display either how many tokens are worth 1 SCRT, or how many SCRT are worth 1 token.  That is, the response lists the symbol of the coin that has less value (either SCRT or the token), and the number of those coins that are worth 1 of the other.

## Usage examples:

To create a new token:

```secretcli tx compute instantiate <code-id> '{"name":"<your_token_name>","symbol":"<your_token_symbol>","admin":"<optional_admin_address_defaults_to_the_from_address>","decimals":<number_of_decimals>,"initial_balances":[{"address":"<address1>","amount":"<amount_for_address1>"}],"prng_seed":"<base64_encoded_string>","config":{"public_total_supply":<true_or_false>,"enable_deposit":<true_or_false>,"enable_redeem":<true_or_false>,"enable_mint":<true_or_false>,"enable_burn":<true_or_false>}}' --label <token_label> --from <account>```

The `admin` field is optional and will default to the "--from" address if you do not specify it.  The `initial_balances` field is optional, and you can specify as many addresses/balances as you like.  The `config` field as well as every field in the `config` is optional.  Any `config` fields not specified will default to `false`.

To deposit: ***(This is public)***

```secretcli tx compute execute <contract-address> '{"deposit": {}}' --amount 1000000uscrt --from <account>``` 

To send SSCRT:

```secretcli tx compute execute <contract-address> '{"transfer": {"recipient": "<destination_address>", "amount": "<amount_to_send>"}}' --from <account>```

To set your viewing key: 

```secretcli tx compute execute <contract-address> '{"create_viewing_key": {"entropy": "<random_phrase>"}}' --from <account>```

To check your balance:

```secretcli q compute query <contract-address> '{"balance": {"address":"<your_address>", "key":"your_viewing_key"}}'```

To view your transfer history:

```secretcli q compute query <contract-address> '{"transfer_history": {"address": "<your_address>", "key": "<your_viewing_key>", "page": <optional_page_number>, "page_size": <number_of_transactions_to_return>, "should_filter_decoys":<should_filter_out_decoys_and_break_paging_or_not>}}'```

To view your transaction history:

```secretcli q compute query <contract-address> '{"transaction_history": {"address": "<your_address>", "key": "<your_viewing_key>", "page": <optional_page_number>, "page_size": <number_of_transactions_to_return>, "should_filter_decoys":<should_filter_out_decoys_and_break_paging_or_not>}}'```

To withdraw: ***(This is public)***

```secretcli tx compute execute <contract-address> '{"redeem": {"amount": "<amount_in_smallest_denom_of_token>"}}' --from <account>```

To view the token contract's configuration:

```secretcli q compute query <contract-address> '{"token_config": {}}'```

To view the deposit/redeem exchange rate:

```secretcli q compute query <contract-address> '{"exchange_rate": {}}'```


## Troubleshooting 

All transactions are encrypted, so if you want to see the error returned by a failed transaction, you need to use the command

`secretcli q compute tx <TX_HASH>`


## SNIP-26: Allowances
Adds the ability for an owner to query for all allowances they have given out, as well as for a spender to query for all allowances they have received.

## Queries

### AllowancesGiven

This query MUST be authenticated.

Returns the list of allowances given out by the current account as an owner, as well as the total count of allowances given out.

Results SHOULD be paginated. Results MUST be sorted in reverse chronological order by the datetime at which the allowance was first created (i.e., order is not determined by expiration, nor by last modified).

#### Request

| Name | Type | Description | optional |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| [with_permit].query.allowances_given.owner | string | Account from which tokens are allowed to be taken | no |
| [with_permit].query.allowances_given.page_size | number | Number of allowances to return, starting from the latest. i.e. n=1 will return only the latest allowance | no |
| [with_permit].query.allowances_given.page | number | Defaults to 0. Specifying a positive number will skip page * page_size txs from the start. | yes |

#### Response
```json
{
  "allowances_given": {
    "owner": "<address>",
    "allowances": [
      {
        "spender": "<address>",
        "allowance": "Uint128",
        "expiration": 1234,
      },
      { "...": "..." }
    ],
    "count": 200
  }
}
```

### AllowancesReceived

This query MUST be authenticated.

Returns the list of allowances given to the current account as a spender, as well as the total count of allowances received.

Results SHOULD be paginated. Results MUST be sorted in reverse chronological order by the datetime at which the allowance was first created (i.e., order is not determined by expiration).

#### Request

| Name | Type | Description | optional |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| [with_permit.]query.allowances_received.spender | string | Account which is allowed to spend tokens on behalf of the owner | no |
| [with_permit.]query.allowances_received.page_size	| number | Number of allowances to return, starting from the latest. i.e. n=1 will return only the latest allowance | no |
| [with_permit.]query.allowances_received.page | number | Defaults to 0. Specifying a positive number will skip page * page_size txs from the start. | yes |

#### Response

```json
{
  "allowances_received": {
    "spender": "<address>",
    "allowances": [
      {
        "owner": "<address>",
        "allowance": "Uint128",
        "expiration": 1234,
      },
      { "...": "..." }
    ],
    "count": 200
  }
}
```

## Privacy Enhancements

 - All transfers/sends (including batch and *_from) use the delayed write buffer (dwb) to address "spicy printf" storage access pattern attacks.
 - Additionally, a bitwise trie of bucketed entries (dwb) creates dynamic anonymity sets for senders/owners, whose balance must be checked when transferring/sending. It also enhances privacy for recipients.
 - When querying for Transaction History, each event's `id` field returned in responses are deterministically obfuscated by `ChaChaRng(XorBytes(ChaChaRng(actual_event_id), internal_secret)) >> (64 - 53)` for better privacy. Without this, an attacker could deduce the number of events that took place between two transactions.


## SNIP-52: Private Push Notifications

This contract publishes encrypted messages to the event log which carry data intended to notify recipients of actions that affect them, such as token transfer and allowances.

Direct channels:
 - `recvd` -- emitted to a recipient when their account receives funds via one of `transfer`, `send`, `transfer_from`, or `send_from`. The notification data includes the amount, the sender, and the memo length.
 - `spent` -- emitted to an owner when their funds are spent, via one of `transfer`, `send`, `transfer_from` or `send_from`. The notification data includes the amount, the recipient, the owner's new balance, and a few other pieces of information such as memo length, number of actions, and whether the spender was the transaction's sender.
 - `allowance` -- emitted to a spender when some allower account has granted them or modified an existing allowance to spend their tokens, via `increase_allowance` or `decrease_allowance`. The notification data includes the amount, the allower, and the expiration of the allowance.

Group channels:
 - `multirecvd` -- emitted to a group of recipients (up to 16) when a `batch_transfer`, `batch_send`, `batch_transfer_from`, or `batch_send_from` has been executed. Each recipient will receive a packet of data containing the amount they received, the last 8 bytes of the owner's address, and some additional metadata.
 - `multispent` -- emitted to a group of spenders (up to 16) when a `batch_transfer_from`, or `batch_send_from` has been executed. Each spender will receive a packet of data containing the amount that was spent, the last 8 bytes of the recipient's address, and some additional metadata.
